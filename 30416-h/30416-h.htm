<h2>BY DAVE DRYFOOS</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Panic</span> roused him&mdash;the black
imp of panic that lived under
the garish rug of this unfamiliar
room and crawled out at dawn to
nudge him awake and stare from
the blank space to his left where
Tillie's gray head should have
been.</p>

<p>His fists clenched in anger&mdash;at
himself. He'd never been the sort
to make allowance for his own
weakness and didn't propose to begin
doing so now, at age eighty-six.
Tillie'd been killed in that
crash well over a year ago and it
was time he got used to his widowerhood
and quit searching for
her every morning.</p>

<p>But even after he gave himself
the bawling out, orientation came
slowly. The surroundings looked
so strange. No matter what he told
himself it was hard to believe that
he was indeed Fred Lubway, mechanical
engineer, and had a right
to be in this single bed, alone in
this house his Tillie had never
seen.</p>

<p>The right to be there was all
wrong. He disliked the house and
hated all its furnishings.</p>

<p>The cybernetic cooker in the
kitchen; the magnetically-suspended
divans in the living room;
the three-dimensional color broadcasts
he could so readily project
to any wall or ceiling; the solartropic
machinery that would turn
any face of the pentagonal house
into the sun or the shade or the
breeze; the lift that would raise
the entire building a hundred feet
into the air to give him a wider
view and more privacy&mdash;all left
him dissatisfied.</p>

<p>They were new. None had been
shared with Tillie. He used them
only to the extent required by law
to fulfill his duty as a consumer.</p>

<p>"You must change your home
because of the change in your family
composition," the Ration
Board's bright young female had
explained, right after Tillie's funeral.
"Your present furnishings
are obsolete. You must replace
them."</p>

<p>"And if I don't?" He'd been
truculent.</p>

<p>"I doubt we'd have to invoke
the penalties for criminal underconsumption,"
she'd explained
airily. "There are plenty of other
possible courses of action. Maybe
we'd just get a decision that you're
prematurely senile and unable to
care for yourself. Then you'd go
to a home for the aged where
they'd <i>help</i> you consume&mdash;with
forced feedings and such."</p>

<p>So here he was, in this home-of-his-own
that seemed to belong
to someone else. Well, at least he
wasn't senile, even if he did move
a little slowly, now, getting out of
bed. He'd warm up soon. All by
himself. With no one's help.</p>

<p>And as far as these newfangled
gadgets in the bathroom were concerned,
he could follow any well-written
set of directions. He'd
scalded himself that time only because
the printed instructions
were so confusing.</p>

<p>He took a cold shower this time.</p>

<p>When the airtowel had finished
blowing and he was half dry&mdash;not
wholly dry because the machine
wasn't adapted to people
who took ice-cold showers&mdash;he
went in to the clothing machine.
He punched the same few holes
in its tape that he put there every
day, stood in the right place, and
in due course emerged with his
long, rawboned frame covered by
magenta tights having an excessively
baggy seat.</p>

<p>He knew the costume was
neither pretty nor fashionable and
that its design, having been wholly
within his control when he punched
the tape, revealed both his taste
and his mood. He didn't care;
there was no one in the world
whom he wanted to impress.</p>

<p>He looked in the dressing room
mirror not to inspect the tights but
to examine his face and see if it
needed shaving. Too late he remembered
that twenty years had
elapsed since the permanent depilatories
were first invented and
ten since he'd used one and
stopped having to shave.</p>

<p>There were too many changes
like that in this gadget-mad
world; too many new ways of doing
old things. Life had no stability.</p>

<p>He stalked into the kitchen
wishing he could skip breakfast&mdash;anger
always unsettled his stomach.
But everyone was required to
eat at least three meals a day. The
vast machine-records system that
kept track of each person's consumption
would reveal to the Ration
Board any failure to use his
share of food, so he dialed Breakfast
Number Three&mdash;tomato juice,
toast, and coffee.</p>

<p>The signal-panel flashed "Under-Eating"
and he knew the state
machine-records system had advised
his cybernetic cooker to increase
the amount of his consumption.
Chin in hands, he sat hopelessly
at the kitchen table awaiting
his meal, and in due course
was served prunes, waffles, bacon,
eggs, toast, and tea&mdash;none of
which he liked, except for toast.</p>

<p>He ate dutifully nevertheless,
telling himself he wasn't afraid of
the ration-cops who were always
suspecting him of underconsumption
because he was the tall skinny
type and never got fat like most
people, but that he ate what the
cooker had given him because his
father had been unemployed for a
long time during the depression
seventy-five years before, so he'd
never been able to bring himself to
throw food away.</p>

<p>Failure to consume had in the
old days been called "overproduction"
and by any name it was bad.
So was war&mdash;he'd read enough
about war to be glad that form of
consumption had finally been
abolished.</p>

<p>Still it was a duty and not a
pleasure to eat so much, and a relief
to get up and put the dirty
dishes into the disposal machine
and go up topside to his gyro.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Disgustingly</span>, he had a long
wait before departure. After
climbing into the gyro and transmitting
his flight plan, he had to
sit seething for all of fifteen minutes
before the Mount Diablo
Flight Control Center deigned to
lift his remote-controlled gyro into
the air. And when the signal
came, ascent was so awkwardly
abrupt it made his ears pop.</p>

<p>He couldn't even complain. The
Center was mechanical, and unequipped
to hear complaints.</p>

<p>It routed him straight down the
San Joaquin Valley&mdash;a beautiful
sight from fifteen thousand feet,
but over-familiar. He fell asleep
and awakened only when unexpectedly
brought down at Bakersfield
Field.</p>

<p>Above his instrument panel the
printing-receiver said "Routine
Check of Equipment and Documents.
Not Over Five Minutes'
Delay."</p>

<p>But it could take longer. And
tardiness was subject to official
punishments as a form of unproductiveness.
He called George
Harding at the plant.</p>

<p>Harding apparently had been
expecting the call. His round bluff
face wore a scowl of annoyance.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever watch the newscasts?"
he demanded angrily.
"They began this 'Routine Check'
you're in at five this morning, and
were broadcasting pictures of the
resulting traffic jam by six. If you'd
filed a flight plan for Santa Barbara
and come on down the coast
you'd have avoided all this."</p>

<p>"I'm not required to listen to
newscasts," Fred replied tartly. "I
own the requisite number of receivers
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, listen, Fred," Harding interrupted.
"We need you down
here so hurry up!"</p>

<p>Fred heard him switch off and
sat for a moment trembling with
rage. But he ended by grinning
wryly. Everyone was in the same
boat, of course. For the most part,
people avoided thinking about it.
But he could now see himself as if
from above, spending his life flitting
back and forth between home
and plant, plant and home; wracking
his brain to devise labor-saving
machines while at the plant, then
rushing home to struggle with the
need to consume their tremendous
output.</p>

<p>Was he a man? Or was he a
caged squirrel racing in an exercise-wheel,
running himself ragged
and with great effort producing
absolutely nothing?</p>

<p>He wasn't going to do it any
longer, by golly! He was going
to&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good morning!" A chubby
young man in the pea-green uniform
of a ration-cop opened the
door and climbed uninvited into
the cockpit. "May I check the up-to-dateness
of your ship's equipment,
please?"</p>

<p>Fred didn't answer. He didn't
have to. The young officer was already
in the manual pilot's seat,
checking the secondary controls.</p>

<p>In swift routine he tried motor
and instruments, and took the craft
briefly aloft. Down again, he demanded
Fred's papers.</p>

<p>The licenses that pertained to
the gyro were in order, but there
was trouble over Fred's personal
documents: his ration-book contained
far too few sales-validations.</p>

<p>"You're not doing your share of
consuming, Oldtimer," the young
cop said mildly. "Look at all these
unused food allotments! Want to
cause a depression?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Man, if you don't eat more
than this, we'll have mass starvation!"</p>

<p>"I know the slogans."</p>

<p>"Yes, but do you know the penalties?
Forced feeding, compulsory
consumption&mdash;do you think they're
fun?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, you can file your flight
plan and go, but if you don't spend
those tickets before their expiration
dates, Mister, you'll have
cause to regret it."</p>

<p>With a special pencil, he sense-marked
the card's margins.</p>

<p>Fred felt that each stroke of the
pencil was a black mark against
him. He watched in apprehensive
silence.</p>

<p>The young cop was also silent.
When finished he wordlessly returned
the identification, tipped
his cap, and swaggered off, his
thick neck red above his green
collar.</p>

<p>Fred found he'd had more than
enough of swaggering young men
with beefy red necks. That added
to his disgust with the constant
struggle to produce and consume,
consume and produce. Vague,
wishful threats froze as determination:
he absolutely wasn't going
through any more of it.</p>

<p>He filed a flight plan that would
return him to his home, and in
due course arrived there.</p>

<p>The phone rang in his ears as
he opened the cockpit. He didn't
want to answer, and he stayed on
the roof securing the gyro and
plugging in its battery-charger. But
he couldn't ignore the bell's insistent
clamor.</p>

<p>When he went downstairs and
switched on the phone, George
Harding's round face splashed on
the wall.</p>

<p>"Fred," he said, "when we
talked a few hours ago, you forgot
to say you were sick. I phoned to
confirm that for the Attendance
Report. Did this call get you out
of bed?"</p>

<p>He could see it hadn't. Therefore
Fred knew he must be recording
the audio only, and not
the video; trying to give him a
break with the Attendance people
and coach him on the most appeasing
answers.</p>

<p>A well-meant gesture, but a
false one. And Fred was fed up
with the false. "I forgot nothing,"
he said bluntly. "I'm perfectly
well and haven't been near bed."</p>

<p>"Now, wait," George said hastily.
"It's no crime to be sick. And&mdash;ah&mdash;don't
say anything you
wouldn't want preserved for posterity."</p>

<p>"George, I'm not going to play
along with you," Fred insisted.
"This business of producing to
consume and consuming to produce
has got me down. It's beyond
all reason!"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't. You're an excellent
mechanical engineer, Fred, but
you're not an economist. That's
why you don't understand. Just excuse
me for a minute, and I'll
show you."</p>

<p>He left the field of view. Fred
waited incuriously for him to return,
suddenly conscious of the
fact that he now had nothing better
to do with his time.</p>

<p>George was back in less than a
minute, anyhow. "O.K.," he said
briskly. "Now, where were we?
Oh, yes. I just wanted to say that
production is a form of consumption,
too&mdash;even the production of
machine-tools and labor-saving devices.
So there's nothing inconsistent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do?"
Fred demanded. "Don't lecture me&mdash;I
know as much econ as you
do!"</p>

<p>"But you've got to come back to
work, Fred! I want you to use your
rations, put your shoulder to the
wheel, and conform generally. The
policing's too strict for you to try
anything else, fella&mdash;and I like you
too well to want to see you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't need you to protect me,
George," Fred said stiffly. "I guess
you mean well enough. But goodbye."
He switched off.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The silence</span> struck him.
Not a sound stirred the air in
that lonely new house except the
slight wheeze of his breathing.</p>

<p>He felt tired. Bone weary. As if
all the fatigues of his eighty-six
years were accumulated within
him.</p>

<p>He stood by a window and
stared blindly out. Everyone
seemed to have been heckling him,
shoving him around, making him
change all his ways every minute.
He didn't want to change. He
didn't want to be forever adapting
to new gadgets, new fads, new
ways of doing things.</p>

<p>He thought of the villages of
India, substantially unchanged for
three, four, five thousand years.
The villagers had no money, so
they couldn't be consumers. Maybe
they had the natural way to
live. Statically. Also, frugally.</p>

<p>But no. It was too frugal, too
static. He'd heard and read too
much about the starvation, pestilence,
peonage and other ills
plaguing those Indian villagers.
They didn't have life licked,
either.</p>

<p>The Indians had not enough,
the Americans, too much. One was
as bad as the other.</p>

<p>And he was in the middle.</p>

<p>He left the window he'd been
staring from unseeingly and walked
to the foyer control-panel. There
he pushed the button that would
cause the house to rear a hundred
feet into the air on its titanium-aluminum
plunger.</p>

<p>Then he went back to the window
to watch the ground recede.
He felt a hand on his shoulder. He
decided the sensation was an illusion&mdash;a
part of his state of mind.</p>

<p>A young man's voice said, "Mr.
Lubway, we need you."</p>

<p>That was a nice thing to hear,
so Fred turned, ready to smile. He
didn't smile. He was confronted
by another ration-cop.</p>

<p>This one was a tall young man,
dark and hefty. He seemed very
kindly, in his official sort of way.</p>

<p>"Mr. George Harding sent me,"
he explained. "He asked us to look
you up and see if we could help."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You seem to have been a little
unhappy this morning. I mean&mdash;well&mdash;staring
out that window
while your house rises dangerously
high. Mr. George Harding
didn't like the mood you're in, and
neither do I, Mr. Lubway. I'm
afraid you'll have to come to the
hospital. We can't have a valuable
citizen like you falling out that
window, can we?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, 'valuable
citizen'? I'm no use to anybody.
There's plenty of engineers, and
more being graduated every semester.
You don't need me."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we do!" Shaking his
head, the young ration-cop took
a firm grip on Fred's right biceps.
"You've got to come along with
me till your outlook changes, Mr.
Lubway."</p>

<p>"Now, see here!" Fred objected,
trying unsuccessfully to twist free
of the officer's grip. "You've no
call to treat me like a criminal.
Nor to talk to me as if I were
senile. My outlook won't change,
and you know it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it will! And since
you're neither criminal nor senile,
that's what has to be done.</p>

<p>"We'll do it in the most humane
way possible. A little brain surgery,
and you'll sit in your cage
and consume and consume and
consume without a care in the
world. Yes, sir, we'll change your
outlook!</p>

<p>"Now, you mustn't try to twist
away from me like that, Mr. Lubway.
I can't let you go. We need
every consumer we can get."</p>
